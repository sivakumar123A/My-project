<p>Babbage was a
 founding member 
of Britainâ€™s Royal
 Astronomical Society,
 and he soon saw 
opportunities for 
innovation in this 
field. Astronomers 
had to make lengthy,
 difficult, and time-consuming
 calculations that could
 be riddled with errors.
 When these tables were
 being used in high stakes 
situations, such as for 
navigation logarithms, 
the errors could prove fatal.
